IMPORTANT: How to Open YouTube Clips on macOS
==========================================

If you see "Apple could not verify YouTube Clips is free of malware" error:

METHOD 1 (EASIEST):
-------------------
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on "YouTube Clips"
2. Select "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" in the dialog
4. Done! App will open normally from now on.


METHOD 2 (ONE-CLICK):
-------------------
1. Double-click "OPEN-APP-MACOS.command" file (included)
2. It will automatically fix and open the app


WHY THIS HAPPENS:
-----------------
macOS blocks unsigned apps from unknown developers.
Professional apps like VS Code pay $99/year for Apple Developer
certificate. We're distributing this app for free.

After opening once with Method 1 or 2, the app works normally
forever. You only need to do this ONCE.
